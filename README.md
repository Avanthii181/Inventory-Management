# Simple Inventory Management System

This is a simple Inventory Management System built using Python's `tkinter` module. It helps users manage their product inventory by allowing them to add, update, delete, and search for products. The system does not persist data between sessions, as the inventory is stored in memory while the program is running.

## Features
- **Add Product**: Add new products with details such as name, price, quantity, and supplier.
- **Update Product**: Update the price and quantity of an existing product.
- **Delete Product**: Remove products from the inventory.
- **Search Product**: Search for products by their name.
- **View Inventory**: View all the products in the inventory.
